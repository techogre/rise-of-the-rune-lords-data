Rather, it gathers under its eaves the six most commonly worshipped deities in the region: Abadar, Desna, Erastil, Gozreh, Sarenrae, and Shelyn. The building provides chapels for all of these deities in a communal forum—in a way, Sandpoint Cathedral is six different churches under one impressive roof.</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:1.25em;padding:0px;direction:ltr;font-family:'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif;font-size:16px;line-height:1.6;text-rendering:optimizelegibility;color:#232323;background-color:#ffffff\">When that chapel burnt to the ground several years ago, Mayor Deverin set into motion a bold initiative.

The new high-priest of Sandpoint is his most accomplished student, a pleasant man named Abstalar Zantus (male human cleric of Desna). Himself a worshiper of Desna, Abstalar is very open about matters of faith and has slipped into the role of advisor for worshipers of other gods of Sandpoint with ease.</p>","folder":"TLYPL3BFLwBVmZzW","sort":1800000,"permission":{"default":2,"ROGVpYYNxM7GPfkA":3},"flags":{}}

The Sandpoint Theater often showcases local talent, but it’s the three weekend shows that locals generally look forward to. Cyrdak uses his contacts in Magnimar to great extent, ensuring that the most exciting new productions in the big city are available here as well.
